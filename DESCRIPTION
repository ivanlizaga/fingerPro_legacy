Description: "Quantifies the provenance of the sediments in a catchment or study area. Based on a comprehensive characterization of the sediment sources and the end sediment mixtures a mixing model algorithm is applied to the sediment mixtures in order to estimate the relative contribution of each potential source. The package includes several graphs to help users in their data understanding such as box plots, correlation, PCA and LDA graphs. In combination, new developments such as the CR and CTS methods developed by Lizaga et al. (2020) and Latorre et al. (2021) are included to correctly apply the fingerprinting technique and increase datasets and model understanding."
